# beginings

This is a rust project that implements multiple algorithms to calculate prime numbers as a CLI.
Operations include running individual algorithms, or running them all and comparing the runtime.

## run formatting

To run, first compile then run the binary followed by two arguments. First is the upper limit of primes to search for, second is the algorithm to use.

Available algorithms are 'eratosthenes', 'naive', and 'not_eratosthenes'.
